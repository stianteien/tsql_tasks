# Tsql tasks
In this repo is the soultions for the tasks in tsql.<br>
I used Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) to write and test the queries. <br>
By importing csv files with data to my local db I could it directly with SMSS.<br><br>
The results can be found in the `results` folder<br>
The files coorospons to the tasks by:

* `1.1` -> `nth_higest_cost.sql`
* `1.2` -> `nth_higest_cost_with_check.sql` 
* `2.1` -> `top3costbrands.sql`
