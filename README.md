# Tsql tasks
This repo contains the soultions for the tasks in tsql.<br>
I used Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) to write and test the queries. <br>
By importing csv files with data to my local db I could write directly in SMSS.<br><br>
The results can be found in the `results` folder<br>
The files corresponding to the tasks:

* `1.1` -> `nth_highest_cost.sql`
* `1.2` -> `nth_highest_cost_with_check.sql` 
* `2.1` -> `top3costbrands.sql`

In `data` are the csv files importen into SSMS.
